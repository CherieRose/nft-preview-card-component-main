## Overview

This is my 3rd FrontEndMentor.io challenge and I chose a very similar layout to my previous 2 challenges to solidify some of the feedback I recieved from previous challenges and streamline my process.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://cherierose.github.io/nft-preview-card-component-main)


### Built with

- VS Code
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I can definitely see the benefit of creating custom CSS variables - this made tweaking my design a lot easier.
